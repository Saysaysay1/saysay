	<h1>Confession Letter</h1>
	<p>Dear Crush,</p>
	<p>I am writing to confess that, I just wanted to tell you that I really admire you and appreciate the way you carry yourself. I wanted to let you know that I have developed feelings for you and I just couldn't keep them to myself any longer. I feel nervous telling you this, but I can't deny how I feel. I find your sense of humor and intelligence so attractive. I understand if you don't feel the same way, and I just wanted to be honest about how I feel. I value your friendship and respect any decision you make.</p>
	<p>I am truly sorry for what I have done and I understand that my actions have hurt you. I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.</p>
	<p>Sayrelle James</p>
